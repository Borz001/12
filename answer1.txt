The main difference between git switch and git checkout lies in their purpose and the specific Git workflow they are designed for:

git switch is a specialized command designed specifically for switching between branches. It provides a more intuitive and focused interface for branch-related operations. When you use git switch, it is assumed that you are primarily working with branches.

git checkout, on the other hand, is a more versatile command historically used for various operations, including switching branches, creating branches, and checking out specific files or commits. While powerful and flexible, its multiple use cases can potentially lead to confusion, especially for users who are new to Git.

In summary, git switch is designed for a more straightforward and error-resistant branch-switching workflow, while git checkout is a more general-purpose command with a broader range of applications. The introduction of git switch and git restore in newer Git versions is part of an effort to provide a more cohesive and user-friendly experience, especially for users who primarily work with branches.
